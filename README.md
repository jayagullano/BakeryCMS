# BakeryCMS
This is a bakery content management system developed for DBAS 6206. With group members Mervat Mustafa and Oghenefejiro Abohweyere, this CMS communicated with a local SQL server database hosted on Visual Studio (C#). The CMS allowed for multiple options for orders, events, and product entry as well as an embedded POS system. The application allowed for reporting on expenses and revenue and allowed for management of payroll systems. The following images are included from the application:
